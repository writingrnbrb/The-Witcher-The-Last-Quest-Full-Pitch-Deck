# TheWitcherTVFanScript
This is a script I'm writing for a TV show adapted from the games + the books for The Witcher franchise. It's just a personal project, nothing commercial, check Readme.txt for legal stuff and the Preface for description/analysis.


And yes it's all done faithfully to Sapkowski and CDPR, below is the legal stuff but for now here are the socials if you want to talk about it/provide credit if you discuss it on YT or whatever:
