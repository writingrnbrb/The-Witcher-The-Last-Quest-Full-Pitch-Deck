Episode 2 - The Lovely Baron Key Details and Information:

Check the preface for a more detailed breakdown.

For now here's the purpose of the episode:

- Establish the central conflict of the season
- Establish the Baron fully (faithfully)
- Continue to build on Geralt
- Establish the "investigation" into the wife and daughter's disappearance
- Establish the "Witcher Senses" more obviously
- Establish the Pellar's conflicts and goals (although not completely)


Key Music:

- Love in Portofino (Used Ironically but Powerfully - Like a Tarantino film.)
- Clint Eastwood - Gorillaz (If possible, that ending is perfect for this song)

Key Scenes:

- The Baron's Room
- The Baron's Village Overhearing two Women
- The Pellar's Introduction
- Finding Princess
- Finding the Witch setup (Keira)

Color Grading Goal:

Very The Boys style, washed out, like an old record player in film form just like 1.
