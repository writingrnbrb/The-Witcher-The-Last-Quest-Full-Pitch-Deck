Episode 3 - Keira Metz Key Details and Information:

Check the preface for a more detailed breakdown.

For now here's the purpose of the episode:

- Establish Keira Metz as a character
- More worldbuilding (The Rotfiends and Villagers)
- Establish the search for Ciri (without giving it away completely - 0 Exposition)
- Establish very briefly the "Big Bad" - The Wild Hunt
- Finalize the Baron's setup.

Key Music:

- On Melancholy Hill - Gorillaz (If possible, that ending is also perfect for this song)

Key Scenes:

- The Road to Keira
- Keira's underground layer & Conversation
- The hunt for the Elven Mage
- The Elven Ruins
- Final Baron Scene

Color Grading Goal:

Very The Boys style, washed out, like an old record player in film form just like 1.
